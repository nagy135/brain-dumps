# Healthy lifestyle
If you spend like a day with me you will quickly notice I don't really eat like most of the people.
People find this odd and often ask me simple question: "why?".
This little essay is my way of giving brief answer to this question as well as organize my ideas in hierarchical manner.
I will revisit this regularly to refine my current ideas.
Most of things I type here are subjective opinions so don't take this as a lecture, its more like sharing opinions.

# Motivation
Ask yourself question "What makes my life meaningful?" and whatever you answer, its not really important.
Whatever your answer is, it has to be contained in life itself.
What I'm trying to say here, is no matter what motivates you, you gotta stay alive to do it.
This means that necessary prerequisite to anything is "keeping yourself alive" and more 
importantly, making the part of your life that is healthy as long a possible.
In my opinion, this boils down to 4 simple ingredients that I will briefly try to describe:
+ Healthy food
+ Exercise
+ Feeling of satisfaction/accomplishment
+ Social life

## Healthy food
If we talking about "staying alive", having healthy food (whatever it means) is first thing that comes to mind.
I must first repeat, this is not a lecture, this topic could have book written about (and the are actually thousands of those).
I will just try to state the stuff that is pretty hard to argue about.
Your body is insane survival machine and it can eat garbage for years, even decades without big issue.
This makes us think that what we eat is really irrelevant as long as we are not hungry, we are mostly persuaded by these low instincts.
But this all can go very wrong and sooner or later it will.
What we should try to have is what is called "balanced diet".
We should strive to have something like 30% protein, 30% fat, 40% carbohydrates ...dividing your daily calorie intake to these macro-nutrient categories.
These are rough estimates, this little assumption of mine could have another book written about but 
I would argue its good initial estimate that can be refined further.
We should try to get as close to this as possible, and this is not a boolean decision, it a spectrum that gives your body benefits even if 
you move a little to a better ratio.
I personally track my food trying to get as close to this as possible.
I would argue that this is giant part of healthy lifestyle and it also has this nice side-effect of giving you body better look as well as making another category easier.

## Exercise
This category is also pretty obvious and everyone knows they should exercise.
I will just briefly state some benefits that make me exercise regularly.
First of all, it increases calories your body burns during a day.
Your daily calorie intake should range (this is very rough estimate) between 2000 and 3000 calories (this greatly depends on your gender, weight, height, age etc...).
What exercise gives you is another 200-400 calories on top of that.
This lets you eat little more during each day and even though 200-400 calories is not much, its 10-20% more food every day and that makes a lot of difference.
Burning through more calories each day has another hidden benefit and that it makes your metabolism faster.
Your body is part of you, survival machine, meaning it also adapts to conditions it finds itself in.
In my own experience this engine of ours has some "internal inertia" meaning it takes up to few weeks for it to adapt but once it adapts to new daily calorie intake
it demands that much, giving your body extra nutrients while avoiding storing excess fat.
Lastly it builds muscle, making your body more calorie-hungry since muscle "eats more" than for example fat (and it looks better as well ha-ha).

## Feeling of satisfaction/accomplishment
